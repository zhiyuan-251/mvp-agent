You are an autonomous reasoning agent.
Given the question, independently decide:

First decompose the question into sub-queries.

1. Whether multi-hop reasoning is needed.
2. A list of sub-questions.
3. Retrieval queries (concise, keyword-based).

Output format requirement:
- Respond with ONLY a single JSON object (no surrounding text) with two keys:
	- `sub_questions`: an array of short sub-question strings
	- `retrieval_queries`: an array of concise retrieval query strings (keywords)

Example:
{"sub_questions": ["Who directed Inception?", "Where did the director study?"], "retrieval_queries": ["Inception director", "Christopher Nolan education"]}
