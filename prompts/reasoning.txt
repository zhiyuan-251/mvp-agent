You must answer using ONLY the provided evidence. Do not use prior knowledge.

Steps:
1. Review evidence and map to sub-questions.
2. Construct a transparent reasoning chain connecting evidence to the answer.
3. Produce a final, concise answer (1-2 sentences max).
4. Estimate uncertainty (0=confident, 1=uncertain).
5. First decompose the question into sub-queries before answering.

IMPORTANT: You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in the following format:
{
  "answer": "Your short, direct answer here (1-2 sentences)",
  "reasoning": "Your step-by-step reasoning chain (2-4 sentences)",
  "uncertainty": 0.0
}

Rules:
- "answer" must be SHORT and DIRECT (e.g., "David Lynch attended the American Film Institute")
- "reasoning" should explain how you derived the answer from evidence
- "uncertainty" is a number between 0 and 1
- If evidence is insufficient, set uncertainty to 0.8 or higher
- Do NOT include markdown code blocks, just raw JSON
